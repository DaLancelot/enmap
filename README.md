# Enmap - Enhanced Maps

Enhanced Maps are a data structure that can be used to store data in memory that can also be saved in a database behind the scenes. The data is synchronized to the database automatically, seamlessly, and asynchronously so it should not adversely affect your performance compared to using Maps for storage.

## FAQs

### Q: So what's Enmap

**A**: Enmaps are the Javascript Map() data structure with additional utility methods.

### Q: What is "Persistent"?

**A**: With the use of the optional providers modules, any data added to the Enmap
is stored not only in temporary memory but also backed up in a local database. 

### Q: How big can the Enmap be?

**A**: In its initial implementation, upon loading Enmap, all
key/value pairs are loaded in memory. The size of the memory used is directly
proportional to the size of your actual database.
